# Annotate Sync

> **Fork of [reviewjs](https://github.com/reviewjs/annotate)** with enhancements for production use.

## What's new in this fork

### Google Sheets sync

Optionally sync comments to a Google Sheet in real time. The sheet doubles as a
live review dashboard — every annotation appears as a row, and any collaborator
with access to the sheet can see, filter, and sort feedback without installing
anything.

#### Setup

1. **Create a Google Sheet** with this header row:

   `annotateId | page | url | type | author | text | color | anchor | geom | resolved | parentId | createdAt | updatedAt`

   The Sheet doesn't need to be shared with reviewers — the Apps Script runs as
   you and writes to it directly. Just make sure the Sheet stays in your Google
   Drive (the script needs access to it). If you want your team to view feedback
   directly in the Sheet, share it with them as **Viewer** (or **Commenter** if
   they should add notes). Reviewers on your website never touch the Sheet
   directly — only the Apps Script does.

2. **Extensions → Apps Script**, paste the contents of
   [`google-sheet.gs`](./google-sheet.gs), and save.

3. **Deploy → New deployment → Web app**:
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone**
   - Copy the web app URL. **The production URL always ends with `/exec`** — do not use a `/dev` URL (those are dev deployments only accessible to the script owner).

4. **Set the URL** with `data-google-sheet="<URL>"` on the script tag — reviewers
   never see a setup prompt. Comments push/pull automatically.

Once connected, comments are pushed to the sheet automatically — create, edit,
reply, and delete all sync within a few seconds. Comments from other reviewers
on the same sheet appear when you load the page.

A **Sync now** button in the comments panel footer lets you force a pull at any
time.

> **No Google account required for reviewers.** The Apps Script runs as the
> sheet owner. Reviewers only need the web app URL.

---

### Hono sync

Sync comments to a self-hosted Hono API that stores them as JSON files.

```bash
cd hono-server && npm install && npm start    # runs on :3099
```

Add `data-hono-url="http://localhost:3099/api/sync"` to the script tag.

### Plugin-based sync architecture

Sync backends are loaded as separate script files, so you only ship what you
need:

```html
<script src="./annotate.js" defer></script>
<script src="./sync-engine.js" defer></script>         <!-- required for any sync -->
<script src="./sync-google-sheet.js" defer></script>    <!-- Google Sheets plugin -->
<script src="./sync-hono.js" defer></script>             <!-- Hono sync plugin -->
```

Each plugin registers via `Annotate.sync.register({...})`. The engine fans out
create/update/delete/pull across all enabled plugins. Plugins communicate
through `Annotate._internals` — no build step, no bundler.

### Other enhancements

- **Plugin-based sync engine** — pluggable remote backends, add your own by implementing `{push, delete, pull, renderStatus}` and calling `Annotate.sync.register()`.
- **Hono sync server** — `hono-server/` with `POST/GET /api/sync`, stores data as `data/<domain>/<page>.json`. 9 test cases included.
- **CORS fix** — `gsPull` GET requests no longer send an unnecessary `Content-Type` header that triggered OPTIONS preflight (405 from Google Apps Script). POST requests use `text/plain` instead of `application/json` to avoid preflight entirely.
- **Stale `GS_URL` fix** — sheet URL changes made via the dialog now actually take effect. Previously the module-level variable was set once at init and never updated.
- **Cancel / close on sheet modal** — clicking outside, pressing Escape, or clicking "Cancel" dismisses the Google Sheets configuration dialog without changing existing settings.
- **Customizable launcher text** — the floating Review pill can be customized (currently reads "Review & Add Feedback to website").

# reviewjs

![A Visual screenshot of Annotatejs](./og-image.png)
**A drop-in visual review & annotation layer for any website.** Highlight text,
draw rectangles & circles, drop pins, sketch freehand and leave threaded
comments — directly on top of your live page.

No backend. No database. No tracking. Comments live in the visitor's own
browser (`localStorage`) and can be **downloaded to / imported from a portable
JSON file** to share with your team.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js" defer></script>
```

That single line is the whole installation.

---

## Why reviewjs?

- **One `<script>` tag.** No build step, no framework, no signup.
- **Works everywhere.** Plain HTML, React, Vue, Svelte, WordPress, Webflow,
  Shopify, static sites — anything that renders HTML in a browser.
- **Local-first & private.** Every comment is stored on the reviewer's device.
  Nothing is sent anywhere.
- **Portable.** Reviewers export their feedback as JSON and send it to you; you
  import it with one click and see every note in place.
- **Polished UI.** A floating toolbar, a Figma-style comments panel, light/dark
  themes that auto-adapt to your page, and full keyboard shortcuts.
- **Tiny & dependency-free.** ~40 KB of vanilla JavaScript, zero dependencies.

---

## Quick start

### 1. The fastest way (CDN)

Add this just before `</body>`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js" defer></script>
```

That's it — reload the page and the toolbar appears in the bottom-right corner.

> **Pin a version** for production stability:
> `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate@1.0.1/annotate.js`
>
> unpkg works too:
> `https://unpkg.com/@reviewjs/annotate@1.0.1/annotate.js`

### 2. Self-hosted

Download [`annotate.js`](./annotate.js), drop it next to your HTML and:

```html
<script src="/annotate.js" defer></script>
```

---

## Configuration

Configure with `data-` attributes on the script tag — all optional:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js"
  data-project="marketing-site"
  data-accent="#6d28d9"
  data-theme="auto"
  data-position="bottom-right"
  data-start-open="true"
  data-note="Focus on the hero copy and pricing — flag anything off-brand."
  data-share-email="reviews@example.com"
  defer
></script>
```

| Attribute | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `data-project` | `""` | Namespace for stored comments. Keep separate sites apart. |
| `data-page` | `location.pathname` | Page key comments are grouped under. |
| `data-accent` | — | Brand color for primary buttons & the active tool. |
| `data-theme` | `auto` | `light`, `dark`, or `auto` (sniffs your page background). |
| `data-position` | `bottom-right` | `bottom-right` or `bottom-left`. |
| `data-blocks` | sensible default | CSS selector for "section note" (+) targets. |
| `data-start-open` | `false` | Set to `true` to show the review toolbar immediately instead of the collapsed Review pill. |
| `data-note` | — | Author's note to reviewers — what should be reviewed. Shown when they start and atop the comments panel. |
| `data-share-email` | — | Where reviewers send comments: an email address, or a Slack / Hangout link. Adds a **Share** button. |
| `data-google-sheet` | — | Deployed Google Apps Script web app URL for auto-sync. Reviewers are prompted for this on first use if not set. |

Prefer JS config? Set `window.AnnotateConfig` **before** the script loads:

```html
<script>
  window.AnnotateConfig = {
    project: "marketing-site",
    accent: "#6d28d9",
    theme: "auto",
    note: "Focus on the hero copy and pricing — flag anything off-brand.",
    shareEmail: "reviews@example.com",
  };
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js" defer></script>
```

---

## Framework integration

reviewjs is a plain browser script, so the goal everywhere is the same:
**load `annotate.js` once, after the page has rendered.** Below are copy-paste
recipes.

### ⚛️ React (and Next.js)

Load it once at the app root with a `useEffect`:

```jsx
// components/Annotate.jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function Annotate() {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (document.getElementById("annotate-js")) return;
    window.AnnotateConfig = { project: "my-react-app", accent: "#6d28d9" };
    const s = document.createElement("script");
    s.id = "annotate-js";
    s.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js";
    s.defer = true;
    document.body.appendChild(s);
  }, []);
  return null;
}
```

```jsx
// App.jsx
import Annotate from "./components/Annotate";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Annotate />
      {/* your app */}
    </>
  );
}
```

**Next.js (App Router)** — drop the `<Script>` into `app/layout.js`:

```jsx
import Script from "next/script";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Script
          src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js"
          strategy="afterInteractive"
        />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 🟩 Vue 3

```vue
<!-- App.vue -->
<script setup>
import { onMounted } from "vue";

onMounted(() => {
  if (document.getElementById("annotate-js")) return;
  window.AnnotateConfig = { project: "my-vue-app", accent: "#10b981" };
  const s = document.createElement("script");
  s.id = "annotate-js";
  s.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js";
  s.defer = true;
  document.body.appendChild(s);
});
</script>
```

Or, even simpler, add the `<script>` tag straight into `public/index.html`
(Vue CLI) / `index.html` (Vite) before `</body>`.

### 🧩 WordPress

**Option A — no code.** Install a "header/footer scripts" plugin (e.g. *WPCode*
or *Insert Headers and Footers*) and paste this into the **footer** box:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js" data-project="my-wp-site" defer></script>
```

**Option B — theme code.** Add to your theme's `functions.php`:

```php
function reviewjs_enqueue() {
  wp_enqueue_script(
    'reviewjs',
    'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js',
    array(),
    '1.0.1',
    true // load in footer
  );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'reviewjs_enqueue' );
```

> Tip: wrap the enqueue in `if ( current_user_can('edit_posts') )` to show the
> review tools only to logged-in editors.

### 🔷 Svelte / SvelteKit

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+layout.svelte -->
<script>
  import { onMount } from "svelte";
  onMount(() => {
    const s = document.createElement("script");
    s.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js";
    s.defer = true;
    document.body.appendChild(s);
  });
</script>

<slot />
```

### 🅰️ Angular

In `angular.json`, add to the `"scripts"` array:

```json
"scripts": [
  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js"
]
```

### 🌐 Plain HTML / static sites / Webflow / Shopify / Squarespace

Paste before `</body>` (or into the platform's "custom code / footer" field):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@reviewjs/annotate/annotate.js" defer></script>
```

## Sharing comments

Because everything is local, sharing is an explicit, privacy-friendly action:

1. A reviewer opens the **Comments panel** (toolbar list icon or press `A`).
2. They click **Download** (⬇) to save a `annotate-<page>-<date>.json` file.
3. They send you that file.
4. You open the same page, click **Import** (⬆), pick the file — every comment
   reappears anchored in place.

You can also drive this from code (see the API below).


## JavaScript API

A global `window.Annotate` is available once the script loads:

```js
Annotate.open();              // show the review layer and open the comments panel
Annotate.close();
Annotate.toggle();
Annotate.enable();            // show the review layer
Annotate.disable();           // collapse to the launcher
Annotate.setTool("highlight");// show the layer, then choose cursor | highlight | rect | circle | pen | pin
Annotate.comments();          // → array of comment objects for this page
Annotate.focus(id);           // scroll to & highlight a comment
Annotate.export();            // trigger the JSON download
Annotate.import();            // open the file picker
Annotate.clear();             // delete all comments on this page (local)
Annotate.toast("Saved!");     // show a toast
Annotate.version;             // "1.0.1"
```

### Comment shape

```json
{
  "id": "c…",
  "page": "marketing-site:/pricing",
  "url": "https://example.com/pricing",
  "type": "highlight",
  "author": "Jane Doe",
  "text": "This price looks out of date.",
  "color": "#f59e0b",
  "anchor": { "exact": "…", "prefix": "…", "suffix": "…" },
  "geom": null,
  "resolved": false,
  "replies": [],
  "createdAt": "2026-06-16T10:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-16T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```
